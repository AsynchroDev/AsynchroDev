## About me
Hey! I'm Asynchro, an amateur programmer obsessed with AI and tables. I'm from Mexico, and yeah, I love tacos (stop with the stereotypes). I'm 16 years old and... did I say I like AI?

I mainly code in lua, but I actually know java, javascript, python and my next goal is probably C++ or C#
